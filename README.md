# XGBoost-Ray demo

https://github.com/ray-project/xgboost_ray

## Instructions

demo.ipynb is same as demo_final.ipynb, with the exception of missing of two cells that should be filled in live during the demo.

Before starting the demo, run create_learnable_data.py, specifying only the path. Set the `data_path` variable at the end of the first cell in the demo.ipynb file to the path you used.
